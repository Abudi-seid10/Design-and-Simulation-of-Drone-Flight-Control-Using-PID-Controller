# Design and Simulation of Drone Flight Control Using PID Controller

This repository contains the MATLAB simulation and design files for a quadcopter flight control project, emphasizing the use of PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers for stabilizing and controlling the drone's flight in three dimensions. The project aims to develop a robust control system that ensures stable, responsive, and precise flight under various conditions.

## Overview

The project utilizes mathematical modeling, PID controller design, and simulation in MATLAB/Simulink to achieve precise control over the drone's attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) and altitude. The main focus is on stabilizing the drone's flight and enabling effective trajectory tracking through optimized PID controller gains.

## Files Included

- `Drone_3D_Trajectory_Motion.m`: MATLAB script for simulating drone's 3D motion.
- `Drone_3D_Trajectory_vs_Desired.m`: MATLAB script for comparing the drone's trajectory with the desired path.
- `Design and Simulation of Drone Flight Control Using PID Controller Final.pdf`: Detailed documentation of the project, including objectives, methodology, simulation results, and conclusions.

## Requirements

- MATLAB and Simulink for running simulations.
- Basic understanding of control systems and PID controllers.
